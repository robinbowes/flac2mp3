Modified version by Carl Asplund, rev 5 (February 2013)
 - Reintroduce progress reporting, this time with full support for parallel processing. The estimated 
   finish time is given after 20 s of transcoding, based on transcoding rate and the total file size 
   left to transcode.
 - No longer output messages directly during transcoding or tagging of a file, but save them in a 
   buffer and use the callback function "run_on_finish" of Parallel::Forkmanager to display them when 
   the corresponding child exits.
 - First perform a separate processing loop for files that don't require transcoding, while at the same time saving
   the names of the files that do need transcoding. This first loop doesn't employ parallel processing, whereas the second, 
   transcoding loop does, through the use of the Parallel::Forkmanager module.
 - Change file permissions of the tempfile/mp3-file in Tag::MP3::ID3v2 to default value (as determined by umask).
   File permissions will otherwise (on *nix) be 0600 due to the odd ways of the File::Temp module (not observing the umask).
   0600 file permissions make the files invisible to some software (as is the case with Logitech Media Server). 
 - Turn off id3 v2.3 unsyncing - again - for increased compatibility with broken software. This time due 
   to inability of Logitech Media Server to cope with it.
 - Update Parallel::Forkmanager to v1.0.2

Modified version by Carl Asplund, rev 4 (February 2013)
 - Added option "--delete". When enabled, any files in the destination
   directories which are not accounted for in the source directories will
   be deleted before transcoding begins. In this way, the destination is kept perfectly in sync with the source,
   even when files and/or directories have been renamed.
 - Copying non-flac files now honors skipfiles (i.e. not copying directories with a skipfile)
 - Refactored code for the translation of paths from source to target directories.
 - Bugfix: Now properly suppresses all output with option "--quiet" 

Modified version by Carl Asplund, rev 3 (January 2013)
 - First version which combines embedded album art, multi-CPU processing, and copying of 
   non-flac files present in the flac folders (which, for some, is another way of handling album art)
 - Extensive refactoring of code, everything built up from latest revision in Robin 
   Bowes' repository: r157
 - Fixed problem with paths under MS Win systems: volume (eg. "C:") was not preserved in r157
 - Various small fixes of broken code in r157 (addressing e.g. tickets #94 and #134)
 - Code for embedded album art now integrated into Robin's code for the other tags
 - Using Parallel::Forkmanager instead of Proc::ParallelLoop which solves two problems: 
	1. Bug in Proc::ParallelLoop casues crash for asymmeteric loads, module seems to be abandoned since 2003
	2. Parallel::Forkmanager works under MS Win (Proc::ParallelLoop doesn't)
 - Fixed race condition bug for creation of target directory (previous code broken, would sometimes skip transcoding files)
 - Fixed race condition bug in MP3::Tag::ID3v2, which has severely broken temp file generation code 
   in original version (see https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=66768)
   Thanks to Jason Rhinelander for posting a very useful patch on CPAN.
 - Progress report and estimated-time-to-finish removed for now. Will adress this later (parallel 
   processing calls for another solution)
 - Known problems: Parallel processing under MS Win is not perfectly stable, MP3::Tag will sometimes be unable to 
   rename temp files during heavy I/O operation (multiple parallel threads with lame and/or flac running), thus 
   skipping the file in question. However, parallel code works flawlessly on MS Win when actual transcoding 
   is replaced by sleep() or counting loops. Sometimes a short, 1 sec, sleep will suffice if unable to rename, 
   before successfully retrying rename operation. Problem seems to be unrelated to filename conflicts and 
   possibly goes deeper than the CPAN modules used.
 
Modified version by Carl Asplund, rev 2 (November 2012)
 - Non-flac files are copied to dest directory only when the source and target
   md5 numbers don't match
 - Progress is displayed during copying of non-flac files
 - Added option "--dontcopy" (Don't copy non-flac files to dest directories)

Modified version by Carl Asplund (August 2009)
 - Embedded picture data (album art) in flac file is copied over to the mp3 file
 - Estimated time to finish and progress is displayed during transcoding 
 - Non-flac files in the folders (jpg, mp3 files etc.) are copied over to destination folders

v0.3.0
 - Remove File::Glob (it's in core) and add Text::Glob 
 - Re-work & refactor the search/checking code
 - Update to bundled CPAN modules (MP3::Tag 1.11, File::Which 1.09)
 - Use FLAC MD5 checksum to determine whether or not to transcode the file
 - Add "--pretend" option
 - Handle multiple tags of the same type, e.g. multiple Artist tags
 - Update how command-line switches interact (--tagsonly now overrides
   --force)
 - Write two separate notifications - one for transcoding, one for tags
 - make file search case-insensitive (.flac and .FLAC)
 - only check for ".flac" at the end of the filename
 - Fix detection of flac/lame executables
 - Add instructions about how to specify flac/lame paths
 - Change quoting of flac/lame command
 - Change shebang (apparently, env is usually in /usr/bin)
